Discord Bot Ezekiel
===

This is a powerful and robust discord bot built on top of discord.js. It's code has been battle tested inside [Sanctum](https://github.com/Ratstail91/SANCTUM), but I've decided to isolate the best code into a single bot, which can act as a template for others.

Ezekiel was the model for Sanctum's bots, and in turn drew from Sanctum for upgrades - everything comes full circle.
